# OBJ Viewer

This is a homework of 2023 Computer Graphics course in NTPU, Taiwan.

Given a skeleton code, I implemented an OBJ viewer with OpenGL.

This program loaded an OBJ file and a specified MTL file to create mesh data. Then the model as well as the lights were rendered using Blinn-Phong lighting model. Finally, image textures were loaded for spatially-varying diffuse coefficients.
